This is a fork of [Alpha Zero General (any game, any framework!)](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general) with appropriate extensions/changes to apply the AlphaZero framework for scheduling problems. Note that changes are made to core classes such as Coach, Arena, MCTS, etc, while existing game implementations have not been changed. In other words: these will no longer work.
